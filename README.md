# EV-Chargers
Gas stations outnumber public charging stations by around seven to one.
It’s no wonder people get so nervous about driving an electric car.
Numerous studies have shown that consumers steer clear of EVs
because they worry about the lack of charging stations.
Studies also show that consumers are more likely to buy an electric car
when they see stations around town. While fears about range anxiety
are largely unfounded–even the cheapest EVs sport enough range to serve
nearly all of a driver’s needs–the paucity of charging stations is a real concern
on longer trips, and it is deterring consumers from going all-electric.
